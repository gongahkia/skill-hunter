FUA 
    * rewrite existing functionality from the groundup, of defining certain words within statutes inline 
    * add additional URL links so those words can be clicked to be brought to the definition section
    * add an outline / minimap of each section and subsection at the side of the webpage that has clickable links so users can easily navigate statutes
    * integrate further functionality such as 
        * statutes referenced within other statutes can be linked and their respective URLs will be clickable as well
        * mention of a given limb or section dependent on other sections will also be clickable, can be brought to that dependent section immediately
    * rewrite the frontend to be pretty and minimal with nice smooth animations 
    * allow statutes and their composite sections and subsections to fold accordingly
    * draw my own logo for skill-hunter v2 on my ipad based on my purple and green character wearing chrollo lucifer's clothes and carrying an inspired book maybe? then place within the local_asset folder and add to the overall README.md
    * clean up the description, screenshots and installation instructions in the README.md
    * HARD DEADLINE 15 Nov to get skill_hunter up and running, email Jerrold Soh then to sell my app and harvest free classpart if possible
    * test to ensure the browser extension runs on all statutes including longer ones like the Penal Code
    * integrate scraping using playwright if possible, otherwise look into continue using the HTML DOM API to access fields immediatly
    * look into other JS libraries for parsing dom structure and making the UI look better
