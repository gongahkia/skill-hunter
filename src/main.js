/*
FUA 
    * rewrite existing functionality from the groundup, of defining certain words within statutes inline 
    * add additional URL links so those words can be clicked to be brought to the definition section
    * edit manifest.json further later
    * learn how background workers in manifest v3 work and consider integrating a background script as necessary
    * add an outline / minimap of each section and subsection at the side of the webpage that has clickable links so users can easily navigate statutes
    * integrate further functionality such as 
        * statutes referenced within other statutes can be linked and their respective URLs will be clickable as well
        * mention of a given limb or section dependent on other sections will also be clickable, can be brought to that dependent section immediately
        * allow statutes and their composite sections and subsections to fold accordingly
    * rewrite the frontend to be pretty and minimal with nice smooth animations 
    * consider centralising the pop-up button 
    * also consider directly rendering the button as a component onto the screen that can then be clicked if need be, see createGenericButton() function
    * consider adding a local notepad that users can use to save specific statutes or an AI integration that explains what a given statute means to users
    * add a script or automated browser program (perhaps with playwright or selenium) that opens the user's local browser and handles AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION of skill_hunter for them, and ask GPT for help implementing this if idk how
    * allow user customisation via specification of additional configurations within a local .json file users can place in the same directory as the manifest.json
        * add serialising and deserialising functions to read this config.json
        * add documentation for what can be customised in the README.md
    * add other colorschemes and font customisation such as
        * dark mode
        * light mode
        * gruvbox
        * everforest
        * etc. (see more colorschemes from vsc)
        * arial
        * times new roman
        * comic sans
    * draw my own logo for skill-hunter v2 on my ipad based on my purple and green character wearing chrollo lucifer's clothes and carrying an inspired book maybe? then place within the local_asset folder and add to the overall README.md
    * clean up the description, screenshots and installation instructions in the README.md
    * HARD DEADLINE 15 Nov to get skill_hunter up and running, email Jerrold Soh then to sell my app and harvest free classpart if possible
    * test to ensure the browser extension runs on all statutes including longer ones like the Penal Code
    * integrate scraping using playwright if possible, otherwise look into continue using the HTML DOM API to access fields immediatly
    * look into other JS libraries for parsing dom structure and making the UI look better 
    * test out functionality of browser extension on the following browsers, then specify which browsers the extension is functional for in the README.md under browser support
        * google chrome
        * microsoft edge
        * brave
        * opera
        * mozilla firefox 
        * safari (come up with a browser-specific version for portability and runnability on macs if required)
