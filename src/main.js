    * rewrite existing functionality from the groundup, of defining certain words within statutes inline

    * integrate further functionality such as 
        * statutes referenced within other statutes can be linked and their respective URLs will be clickable as well
        * mention of a given limb or section dependent on other sections will also be clickable, can be brought to that dependent section immediately
        * allow statutes and their composite sections and subsections to fold accordingly
    * rewrite the frontend to be pretty and minimal with nice smooth animations
