- Consider adding a general link to FAQs [here](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Help/FAQ).
- Figure out if I can make the hovering definition prettier, like the previous definitions in version 1 of this project.
    - Add additional URL links so those words can be clicked to be brought to the definition section.
- Add code that handles the conversion of newline characters and other non-HTML specific characters to HTML so that the text is rendered cleanly when fed back and displayed.
- Add further support to separate and store part numbers and part headers in the created JSON.
- Integrate further functionality such as:
    - Statutes referenced within other statutes can be linked, and their respective URLs will be clickable.
    - Mentions of a given limb or section dependent on other sections will also be clickable and can bring users to that dependent section immediately.
    - Allow statutes and their composite sections and subsections to fold accordingly.
        - Implement with the collapsible class using code from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp).
- Allow user customization via specification of additional configurations within a local `.json` file users can place in the same directory as the `manifest.json`.
    - Add a UI button on the pop-up page to tweak settings.
        - Add functionality and link to:
            - Change font.
            - Change color scheme.
            - Functions I've implemented above.
        - Add serializing and deserializing functions to read this `config.json`.
        - Add documentation for what can be customized in the `README.md`.
        - Rewrite the frontend to be pretty and minimal with nice smooth animations.
            - Reference idea: ![Reference](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62dabe5dc266a398da4d2629/62fcf2e4a604ce2bd71b7011_all-activities.png)
- Consider adding a local notepad that users can use to save specific statutes or an AI integration that explains what a given statute means to users.
- Consider handling the installation of **skill_hunter** using Docker or some other tools; ask GPT what other tooling alternatives there are for this.
